*Look at it instead since MarioSpriteFactory class has more than 250 lines of code

Comments:
I think that this class is not hard to maintain mostly even thought there are many variables and functions required for 
the spriteFactory. For example, if now we have another Mario pictures added . the file, we will have three 
neccessary steps to make it work with the new element. However, I think maybe we can make the class more maintainable.
Since in the future, we need to repeat all these three steps (variable creation, load picture, methods) whenever 
we add a new element. I think, in general, we can improve the factory at some point since it takes a while to set up
the new states. There is a way in which we can add new sprite by indicating what the sprite is instead of three, which 
would help us maintain the class in the rest of the project. Also, it may also make the other classes more maintainable.
