Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
In MarioItemHandler.cs, the readability is good. In HandlerCollsion method, if there is a collision between Mario and item, 
then call specific item to handle the response of collision. But the name of file can be improved. MarioItemHandler is a little confusing. 
Instead MarioItemCollisionHandler is better. Reader can understand it is a class to handler to handle the collision between item and Mario. 

In Flower.cs, and other item.cs file, they take different response based on the collision side.  But he got stateName and compared stateName with a specific statename. 
It is acceptable, but can be done better. He can just use if(currentPowerState is MarioStarSmallState).
