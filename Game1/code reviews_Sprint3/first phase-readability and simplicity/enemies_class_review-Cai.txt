Generally speaking, this piece of code have a high readability, because it satisfy these qualities in various 
degree.

comments in specific aspects:

-------------------------------------------------------   1   ---------------------------------------------

Standards of indentation and formatting are followed, so that the code and its structure are clearly 
visible.
score: 4/5
example: in Goomba.cs

/////
        public void BeFlipped()
        {
            State = new GoombaFlippedState();
        }

        public void BeStomped()
        {
            State = new GoombaStompedState();
        }

        public void ChangeDirection()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

/////

all these general purpose functions have integrity on purpose achievement and function formatting,
beside this, he put the "heavy" trunck and update function in the end, make it easier to read


-------------------------------------------------------   2   ---------------------------------------------

Variables are named meaningfully, so that they communicate intent.
score: 5/5

example: in Goomba.cs

/////
	
		private IEnemyActionState State;
        public Vector2 Location { get ; set ; }
        public Rectangle Rectangle => new Rectangle((int)Location.X, (int)Location.Y, State.Width, State.Height);
		....
		....
		public void CollidedWithMario(IPlayer mario, Direction direction)

/////

in terms of private and public variables, the author did a great job on specified public and private to prevent 
information leak

-------------------------------------------------------   3   ---------------------------------------------

Functions are short and to the point, and do one thing.
score 2/5

problem need to be fixed:
	1. there is a function called ChangeDirection() in this enemies interface however it hasn't been implemented yet
		maybe consider remove or redefine it
	2. there are same name function in state interface which are repeating function of BeFlipped() and BeStomped()
		maybe communicate with state interface coder to solve this problem.
