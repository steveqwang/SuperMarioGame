Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

Over all, the readability of the file is good. The IPlayer variable name is player in some files, but in some files 
it is Mario, which will confuse the reader and should be unified. I noticed that in the factory, a lot of switch cases are 
used, which will require more switch statements in the future. There may be a better solution.There are a lot of magic numbers in 
the factory, which may cause difficulties in understanding.
