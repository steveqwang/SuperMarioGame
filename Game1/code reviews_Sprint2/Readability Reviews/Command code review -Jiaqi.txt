Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

In general, the code in command is readable. It initialize the receiver in constructor and 
call receiver's method in execute method. But some receiver's name can be changed to make it more understandable. For example,  
class HiddenToUsedCommand : Interfaces.ICommand 
    {
        private HiddenBlock Brick;

        public void Execute()
        {
            Brick.BecomeUsed();
        }
        public HiddenToUsedCommand(HiddenBlock UpdateBrick)
        {
            Brick = UpdateBrick;
        }
    }

It should just name HiddenBlock object as hiddenBlock and HiddenBlock object in constructor parameters can be named as receiver or just hiddenBlock.
