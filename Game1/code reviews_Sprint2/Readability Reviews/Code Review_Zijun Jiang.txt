Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

namespace Game1.States
{
    class QuestionBlockStates:IBlockState
    {
        private ISprite blockSprite;

        public QuestionBlockStates()
        {
            blockSprite = BlockSpritesFactory.Instance.CreateQuestionBlockSprite();
        }
        public void Update()
        {

        }
        public void BecomeUsed()
        {
            blockSprite = BlockSpritesFactory.Instance.CreateUsedBlockSprite();
        }

        public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, Vector2 location)
        {
            blockSprite.Draw(spriteBatch, location);
        }

    }
}

The code is quite readable, the method name BecomeUsed() is clear indentify the two states of Questionblock, showing in question block and showing in used block.
However, IBlockState interface is not very good in readbility. Since the IBlockState may not only contains method BecomeUsed() like brick block should have the ability to disapper.
