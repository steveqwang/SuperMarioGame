Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

In general, these two authors wrote readable codes in all block classes. They both 
followed the naming paterns and made the codes consistant. They also used same method header & method 
names in different kind of blocks such that I felt Coherence, when I called their method in my 
command classes as a Client. 
For example, in HiddenBlock.cs, there are two variables one for state change information and one vector for location 
the author created a constructor and initialized these two variables. In every block class type there is a draw method for 
command to put things in game, an update method and a special "becomeUsed" method to change the state of block so that it can 
get dynamic properties. 

namespace Game1.Blocks
{
    class HiddenBlock: IBlock
    {

        private HiddenBlockState State;
        private Vector2 spriteLocation;

        public HiddenBlock(Vector2 position)
        {
            State = new HiddenBlockState();
            spriteLocation = position;
        }

        public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch)
        {
            State.Draw(spriteBatch, spriteLocation);
        }

        public void Update()
        {
       
        }

        public void BecomeUsed()
        {
            State.BecomeUsed();
        }
    }
}
