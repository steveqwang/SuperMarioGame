Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

namespace Game1.Player
{
    public class MarioPlayer
    {
        public enum MarioPowerState { SmallState, BigState, FireState }
        public MarioPowerState currentPowerState;
        public IMarioAnimationState state;
        public double time;
        private bool ifUpdate;
        private double delay = 0.1;

        public MarioPlayer()
        {
            currentPowerState = MarioPowerState.SmallState;
            state = new MarioRightIdleState(this);
            ifUpdate = false;
        }
      
        public void Up()
        {
            if (ifUpdate)
            {
                state.Up();
            }
        }

		...
	}
}

The code is quite readable. The class initialize the value of ifUpdate to false. The value delay is set to false.
The delay value can be set to read only since it won't be changed in the class. And the value ifUpdate can be changed to other
words like "action".
