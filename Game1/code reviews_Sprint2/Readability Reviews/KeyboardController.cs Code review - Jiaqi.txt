Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

In general, the readability of KeyboardController's code is good. In constructor, it initializes the dictionary to map the key and corresponding command. In Update method, it execute the command related to pressed key. But I think the name of dictionary  
private readonly Dictionary<Keys, ICommand> MappingDictionary;
can be improved. It is better to call KeysToCommandMappingDictionary or some name can show 
The relationship between key and command.
