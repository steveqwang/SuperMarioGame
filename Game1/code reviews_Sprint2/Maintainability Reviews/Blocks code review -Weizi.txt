Sprint 2

File: all cs files with name space of 'Game1.Blocks'
Author of these .cs file:  Zijun Jiang & Jiaqi Wang
Comments on code quality:
By this sprint, all of the block classes should work fine. The block files works as a classes to inhirite from IObjects interface. 
The file uses *****Block() method to construct different types of blocks. Also, the file uses Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch) method 
that was inheritted from Iobject to draw with spriteBatch, at a given location 'spriteLocation'. 
Currently this is a very good way of implement and organize block and its methods. However we should think about future.
In the future we are going to create a whole mario game world, in that case, we will need a lot of different types of blocks.
by that time, implementation of new type of block could be redundent because lots of block would need a common method, such
as draw, contructor *****Block() and update. Beside these default methods, we might would need certain blocks to achieve
new functions.
Thus, one another way of approach is to use a abstract class and let it implement all the repeat methods, so when it comes
to 100 types of different blocks, it would help us reduce the work amount, and the whole project file size.
