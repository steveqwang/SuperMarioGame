Name of the cs file being reviewed: All command classes

Comments on code quality:
Currently, the commands classes work well. All command classes has receiver and it call corresponding method of receiver in Execute method.
But I think codes in PressRToResetCommand.cs can be imporved. In Execute method, it re create some class to act as reset. Maybe it can be 
seperated to different methods like ResetObject, ResetItem, ResetMario and ResetEnemy. In the future, the reset implementation might be 
more complicated instead of just recreating the class. 

 A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
In the future, the enemy and some items might need to move right and left, so it would require more commands to support such actions. But
actually, Mario, Enemy and item moving left and right commands are very similiar because it just call receiver MoveLeft or MoveRight
Method. In this case, I think we can let Mario class to extend IObject and Change MarioTurnLeftCommand to just MovingLeftCommand,
so all objects need to move left or right can be called by the same command instead of setting a lot of commands having the same action.
