Comments on code quality:

The code quality of Game1.cs is good and it can meet the requirement of Sprint2. It has different initialize methods to initialize different kinds
of objects like Mario, Enemy and item. And in draw and update method, it calls the draw and update method in each object respectively, so
if the implementation of update and draw method in different objects changed, the Game1.cs won't be affected. But code in Game1.cs might not
 be able to accommodate with future updatings. In ItemsInitialize method, it creates each item once with fixed position. In the future,
 the task would be more complicated instead of just showing different items like Sprint2. What's more, in a real game, it needs same object
 to be displayed many times, but in ItemsInitialize method, same object just be created only one time. 

 A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change

 After initialization, users want to see same items showed many times. For example, in a real Mario game, there might be a lot of mushrooms, flowers and coins. 
 If we want to do the samething in Game1.cs, it would require a lot of codes in ItemsInitialize method, which is unacceptable.
