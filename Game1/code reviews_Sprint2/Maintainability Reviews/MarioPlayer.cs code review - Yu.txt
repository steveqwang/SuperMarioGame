Comments on code quality:

The code quality of this class is good. As of right now, this class meets the basic requirement of Sprint2. For now, 
there are many hard coded values existing in the MarioPlayer class and it works well currently. But in the future, there 
will be more requirement and demands. It not only need to show the sprites inside the window but also need to make the 
sprite and something else more data driven. There is no doubt that this class need to be rewritten to accommodate the 
following requirements in the near future. This class may have more actions to be added, like firing, in the next few 
Sprints, and it will also need to change some details in order to meet the upcoming requirements. However, from the 
maintainability perspective, this class, there is not too much things flexible and MarioPlayer should be easy for the 
group one to maintain as well as update for the other specifications in the future.
