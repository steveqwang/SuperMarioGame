This is the Team reflection of sprint 5
We added new functions include and not only: Hud display to show our scores, world ID, and time countdown
we have added special classes to achieve sound effacts. However, most of our time was spent on fixing previous bugs on physics and movement logics.
we also spend about 1 day to modify our code, such as move certain parts of codes to reduce the redundence of some functions in collisions. Overall, we 
want to achieve higher cohesion and lower coupling. Beside that, it also took us a long time to add coin system and bonus system. We should have worked on
that ealier, so that we don't have fix all the code debts related to not using gold and score systems. In general, we achieved a high readability compare to 
what we did in sprint 4.
Speaking of the usage of managment tools, everyone on our team have already become fluent users of Azure DevOps. Without spending extra times on it, each one of 
us strictly followed the guideline and picked our works on the broad. We made sure the working porgress was up to date, and directly showed on broad, as a result 
and reward, we got a clear picture on how many works we have left, how many functions we have already achieved. In this way, we can help each other better. 
Through this semester, I believe everyone on our team has learnt a lot on how to organize and using team managment tools such as Azure DevOps, and we can use it 
toward future careers.
