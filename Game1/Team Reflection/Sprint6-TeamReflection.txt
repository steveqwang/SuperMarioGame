This is the Team reflection of sprint 6
We added new functions include and not only: Boss world, Boss character, Enemy spawn portal, fireHell
we have added special classes corresponding to these features, such as enemy portal class, bowser class for boss, etc.
In the process, we were able to find a lot of bugs which were left from previous sprints. For example, we fixed the bug that mario was able to jump over
the flag and directly go to the final castle.In terms of group time spending and group management, we did a great job due to our well managing the tasks and time. It allows
more linear compared with the sprint2. Team members updated their works progress more frequently, which makes the work flow more smoothy and the overall progress 
is more accurate and it really identifies all pieces of process on the project. 
Speaking of the usage of managment tools, everyone on our team have already become fluent users of Azure DevOps. we are already fluent users to this
system, each one of 
us strictly followed the guideline and picked our works on the broad. We made sure the working porgress was up to date, and directly showed on broad.
For example, Gemini achieved the cheat code functions, jiaqi was in charge of boss level, Yu and Wubin were working on enemy controlled players, Weizi made the 
enemy portal functions. 
as a result 
and reward, we got a clear picture on how many works we have left, how many functions we have already achieved. In this way, we can help each other better. 
Through this semester, I believe everyone on our team has learnt a lot on how to organize and using team managment tools such as Azure DevOps, and we can use it 
towards future.
