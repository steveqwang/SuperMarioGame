This is the Team reflection of sprint 4
We finally finished with the final implementation! On this sprint, we added new functions include and not only: Physics and jumping logic 
for our player, Mario; Movement for types other than the player/mario object, such as our enemies, goomba and koopa, beside that, we also
added movements to items such as mushrooms and star item; Collision detection and response for all moving objects, and last but not least, 
Fireballs (or other player attacking abilities) and Scrolling camera. Speaking of using Azure, suprisingly we dropped the rate of using Azure
team management, this is not good, we need to make changes in next sprint. I think the reason for this, is because every team members have 
already familialized with their work portion, so, as a result, basically everyone know about what change should we make on our own parts. However,
this is not good for long time team managements. 

But, during our discussing when we had meetings and doing our code reviews, we figured that there are still lots of Technical debt left in both our 
codes and our team management, one problem of us is we somehow lack of a test suite, which encourages quick and risky band-aids to fix bugs.
We also got some anti patterns during our colabrations, for example, we some times work like Design by committee, which is The result of having many contributors 
to a design, but no unifying vision. These are the changes we need to make before next sprint due. In general, we got a great communication environment 
in our team.
