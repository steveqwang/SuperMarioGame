After two weeks, we finally finished with the implementation and refactoring with our project. In terms of group time spending and group management, 
we consider ourselves do have a couple of strong points, while we also have some weak points that needs to be improved. Firstly, our strong point: we 
managed the overall time spending in a great balance, we all think about working hard on this project, with the tacit understanding of every single group 
member, we were able to arrange our time in a good pace. Every single phase was finished on time, no delay. Another strong point of us is that we did 
a good division on the project when we initially assigned the work load. We evenly divided the workload, until we finished the project, most of us 
were satisfied with our work load amount. 
Now let’s talk about our weak point. Our major weak point is, even though we followed all the directions and stick with devOps work load planning, we 
were not able to put every single individual task on the broad. As a result, we can’t just directly tell which part were fully implemented by another 
member from neither the broad or the chart. Most of time we have to get into code segments to check whether a method is workable or not. But our burndown 
chart still could partially reflect our work progress, since each member updated our work load every single day (to be more specific, we were precise on 
work load count, but we didn’t be very precise on which person did which job, the broad and burndown chart could only reflect the whole work progress). The 
burndown chart indicates that we were most active as a team during 2/3 since that was the due day of our initial implementation. During last few days we add an 
extra 30 hours for refactoring, thus the remaining work amount raised again.
