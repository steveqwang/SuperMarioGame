Specific comments on code quality:

Overall, the code quality is good. The Handler itself follows all other collision handler cases. The main method is here is handleCollision. The basic
logic inside of this is by loop method to determine how to handle it specifically and then go to handler collision method:

private void HandleCollision(IPlayer mario, FireHell fireHell, Direction direction)
        {
            fireHell.IsRemove = true;
            if (!(mario.CurrentPowerState is MarioStarBigState || mario.CurrentPowerState is MarioStarSmallState))
            {
                mario.TakeDamage();
            }
        }

It is simple enough to tell us that if mario collision with firehell, we should call mario.takedamage()to let mario decrease a life or something like this.

The maintainbility is good since it focuses on its main job and have high cohension. But I would suggest the author to have a Interface for all collsion handler since it
may have same method type and other similar property. By doing this, we can make all collision handler to be more useful and other be more maintainbility.
