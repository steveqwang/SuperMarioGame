There is a lot going on in this player class. A great number of variables are created here. Also, a great number of if statements are chiefly
in this class. Besides, this class is over 200 lines. I think this class can be shorter and more conhecient. Since the class
was growing larger and larger since all team members added methods in this class. And I think we can consider to make 
the class into several pieces and break it into some classes. I think the game would be more easily to maintain. And the 
code reviewer will understand the code more easily.
