Name of the .cs file being reviewed AllCollisionHandler.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed Weizi Cai
Specific comments on code quality:
Overall, the code quality is good. The author tries to refactor allcollsionhandler to minum the codelines and move some codes into specific collisionhandler to
reduce coupling. I can see the author tried to avoid static method such that he used constructor and make nonstatic calles inside the code, examples can be found
as following:
 	.......
        private FireBallBlockHandler FBHandler;
       ........

        public AllCollisionHandler(GameStateManager gameState) {
            this.gameState = gameState;
            Level = gameState.world;
            mario = gameState.world.Mario;
            .......
            FBHandler = new FireBallBlockHandler();
            .......
        }
So the author called it here to avoid static method so he can use this FBHandler method later in this .cs file like:

	 FBHandler.FireBallHandleLoop(BlocksAround, fireball);
               
         FEHandler.FireBallHandleLoop(BlocksAround, fireball, fireballBox, Level, mario); 
So I think the author is making good example of avoiding static method. 
Another thing I notice why author want to do this is try to reduce the complexity of the code, by mininuming functionality of the method, we can let allcolliision
Handler.cs to focus more on detect collision and let others to be more specific. Like the idea to abstrlize the allHandler.
