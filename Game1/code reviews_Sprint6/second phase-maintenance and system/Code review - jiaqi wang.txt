Specific comments on code quality
The overall code quality is good and the code is easy to read.  And the developer binds the cheat code string with relative commands. In this case, 
this code is extensible because developers can add more string - command key value pairs when the game needs more cheat code. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
The code is good, but it can still be improved. In Execute methods like ExecuteSmall method, it just creates new MarioSmallState. This part of code wouldn't work if 
developers add more players in the game.
