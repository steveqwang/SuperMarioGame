"quote: As we know, In the context of programming, program design, or design in general, a design exhibits some flexibility 
if it can adapt to new, different, or changing requirements. Eliminating the term the requirements,which stress the 
design process too much, flexibility refers to the unexpectedly many ways in which a design can be used."

General speaking, the structure in AllCheatCodesManager and ICheatCode class have a pretty high flexibility, because all of them follow 
the same patern, each function has a clear purpose, and we can add anything we want easily, such as new text display, new image etc.
However, because we have only just started on it, we haven't modified the structure of it, so to someone who is not very familiar our 
codes, might be a little hard for them to add new features.

/////
    private string GetInputString() {
            string input = string.Empty;
            foreach (string key in inputString) {
                input = input + key;
            }
            return input;
        }
/////

this is an example of something we can organize them better. Such that even in the future we got more features, we can still handle them 
easily, we could put some of them in a new method to make it more intuitive.
