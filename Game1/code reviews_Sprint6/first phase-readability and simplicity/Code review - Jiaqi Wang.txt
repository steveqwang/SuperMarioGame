Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
Gnerally, the readibility of the code is good. The overall logic in AllCheatCodesManager is get user input and check wheter the user input matches any 
cheat code. If there is a match, invoke the cheat code like Mario go big. The readibility of the code is nice. The name of method can indicate the function of 
method and there are also some comments to demonstrate how the code works.
