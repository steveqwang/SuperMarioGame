Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
In general, the WordState is in good standing for read format. The most format of prototypes in this class is easy to understand. Like World-ID, isPause, canPause.
From the readbility side, I have some suggestions for the entire classes methods.
// example:
  }
        public void Down()
        {
            gameStateManager.world.Mario.Down();
        }
         public void Left()
        {

        }
        public void Right()
        {

        }
	 public void Up()
        {
            gameStateManager.world.Mario.MarioPhysics.jump();
            gameStateManager.world.Mario.Up();
        }
// end of example
I can easily understand that Up() method is to make mario jump and make it to up animation. However, other methods like left or right here are meningless (useless) since
they do nothing here and makes me confused. Like why wordState can be left or right. So I suggest naming here should be MarioGoLeft or MarioGoRight(); Other are generally 
good like coupling is not high and cohesion is in good range.
