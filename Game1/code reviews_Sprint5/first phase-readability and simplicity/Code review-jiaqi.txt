Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
Gnerally, the readibility of the code is good. The overall logic in MenuState is to let player press up and down to select Enter 
the game or quit. The code in MenuState makes developers easy to understand the logic. What's more, there is a coolDown mechanism that prevents selectos moving too fast. 
However,there are some magic numbers in the code. In this case, he needs to move the magic number into Util class in refactoring stage.
