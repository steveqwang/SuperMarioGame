Specific comments on maintainance and system:


comments in general:
A code smell is a hint that something has gone wrong somewhere in your code. Use the smell to track down the problem. Based on
my first code smell of this code, I get this conclusion:
Generally speaking, all 9 .cs file in Collision have a pretty good maintainance quality, however, we need to work harder on
flexibility of the system.

comments in specific aspects:

-------------------------------------------------------   1   ---------------------------------------------

maintenance and flexibility of the system
score: 3/5

These 9 file all have Tightly-coupled components, where functions are not modular, the software is not flexible enough to adapt 
to changes. The direct result is: even it is easy for us to change and debugging these codes, but it would not be a easy thing to
add new cases of collisions to it, for example, some file such as shellenemyhandler is very short, while someothers are very long.
Thus, an abstract would be a great idea. By doing that, we can add new collision cases easily, and make the maintenance hardness even
lower. That would reduce the tech debts for future.
