            {
                Accerlation = new Vector2(-100, Accerlation.Y);
                if (Velocity.X <= 0)
                {
                    Velocity = new Vector2(0, Velocity.Y);
                    Accerlation = new Vector2(0, Accerlation.Y);
                    ResetRun();
                }
            }

These code is coming from the marioPhysicalProperty.cs. I can understand the code functionality easily with its logic. each method is hadnling some cases while 
Mario is running with accerlation. Especially, those boolean variable makes sense in this code such as isInitialRun. However, I notice that the if statement is very long 
and a little bit hard coded. I will suggest the author to have another boolen to handle the if statement and make it short. Another thing I would say is that the firction 
force is not obviously with this code. I would say maybe we can give another method for firction force. Last but not least, I think updateRuningAccerlation is very general 
cases, it has a very low cohension so I would suggest to split this method.
