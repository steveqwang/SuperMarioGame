Specific comments on code quality
The overall code quality is good and the code is easy to read. For example, initially the velocity, acceleration and some boolean values have 
been initialized. In Jump method, when the mario first jump, the mario would have inital upwards velocity and downward acceleration acts like gravtity.
When mario tries to jump in the air, it just update the acceleration. But the code in Update method can be imporved. The logic and correctness
is nice, but it can be more clear. It is a little mess to put a lot of jumping update logic in Update method. Maybe it is better to move this part of code
to UpdateJump method. 
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
It is hard for  programmers try to implement mario with different acceleration and veloctiy. For example, if programmers want implement mario
moves in the water, they would have to write an another method to implement it. But this method might be rewrited as a method with several parameters of inital velocity
and acceleration.
