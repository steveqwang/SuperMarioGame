Review:
Generally speking, these method is in good quality. It has run and reset run method for mario physics. I can easily 
understand some variables names like Velocity and Accerlation. I can see the author of these codes has some good coding
habbits like using :? other than if statement. Some naming boolean varables are in good naming, like isInitialRun. 
Some suggestion from my side is that some constant values like 100f and -100f to be saved as constants value like 
const initialVelocityLeft = 100f or it can be even better to be added into a utility or library namespace so we can put 
all constants togerther later.
