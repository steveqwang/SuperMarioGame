Review:
Generally speaking, these two classes are easy to understand and have a good quality. There's not too much going on in these classes. But there are some nested 
if statements and too many new state. In the future, we might consider reducing the level of nested statements by make more classes like statement manager, so 
that we can enhance the readability. It will also work for fireflower and some other items. 
Overall these two classes are in good quality and the cohesion is just fine but it can still be improved of some part.
