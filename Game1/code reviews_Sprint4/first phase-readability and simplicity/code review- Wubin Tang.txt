Specific comments on code quality:

private void CheckFireBallCollision()
        {
            IBlock[][] blocks = Level.GetBlocks();
            foreach (Fireball fireball in Level.Mario.fireballs)
            {
                Rectangle fireballBox = fireball.Rectangle;
                for (int i = 0; i < blocks.Length; i++)
                {
                    for (int j = 0; j < blocks[i].Length; j++)
                    {
                        if (blocks[i][j] != null)
                        {
                            Rectangle blockBox = blocks[i][j].Rectangle;
                            Rectangle intersectionBox = Rectangle.Intersect(blockBox, fireballBox);
                            if (!intersectionBox.IsEmpty)
                            {
                                Direction direction = GetCollisionDirection(intersectionBox, fireballBox, blockBox);
                                FireBallHandler.HandleCollision(fireball, blocks[i][j], direction);
                            }

                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

This method has too many loops and it will slow down the whole game. And for so many loops, it's hard to figure out which two things have collisions.
And I notice that game1 and camera both have GetMatrixView(), but the one in game1 is being used. But, I think it's better to put these camera things 
in one folder instead of Game1.cs due to easier find and future plan. For the fireball.cs, the jump method's name is wierd, because fire ball cannot jump.
