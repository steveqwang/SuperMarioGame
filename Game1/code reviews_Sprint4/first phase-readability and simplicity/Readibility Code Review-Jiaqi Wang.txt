Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
In EnemyBlock class, the readibility of HandleCollision is good. when the method is called, it just call the CollisionWithEnemy method
to deal with the collision between enemy and block. However, In UpdateLocation method, the readibility can be improved. In each
case, it has something to do with enemy.EnemyPhysics. Maybe it can move everything with enemy.EnemyPhysics to a new method 
call UpdatePhysics or something. 
In ShellEnemyHandler, the name of parameters should be improved because just naming enemy2 and enemy1 would be confusing.
